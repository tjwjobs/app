<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
  when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an
  adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo
  to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
  force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h4>Thorin Oakenshield</h4>
    <p>
      Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the
      Mountain King,[1] was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin
      and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin
      was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the
      lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading
      an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.

    <h4>Fili and Kili</h4>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set
      out on Thorin Oakenshield's quest along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins to
      reclaim the Lonely Mountain for the Dwarves. Fíli and Kíli were the two
      most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and
      possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters
      in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who were most
      often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

    <h4>Óin</h4>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
      joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood.Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
      come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother
      Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He
      fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in
      the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of
      Thorin.

        Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II
        Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord
        known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of
        Thorin's closest friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to
        him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin. He later went to
        re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome
        once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his
        companions.

              <p>
                Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of
                The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of the Rings.
                Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo
                Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later
                fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of
                the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give
                it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his
                adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo
                adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his
                heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck,
                drowned in the Brandywine River. Bilbo was the first Hobbit to
                become famous in the world at large and was one of the few to
                visit The Undying Lands across the ocean.
